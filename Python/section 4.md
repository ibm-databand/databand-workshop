Section 4: Broken flow
a. Break Python script
Here your Python experience is helpfull! You are going to break the scripts in a way so you know what is broken in the scripts and how this will be represented in Databand. Do not break all three of them, this is a Databand learning exercise. 

Hint: Take a peak at Databand alerts and try to create a "breaking point" that would match a alerting type.

b. Run Python scripts (a few times)
Databand is trying to interpret the provided logging metadata and correlate the data to existing data. This is how lineage is being composed. For that it needs a few pipeline runs to be executed. Run the scripts locally. Solve anny issues and make sure you at least have 5 run results per script in Databand.

c. Review databand.ai
Goto the Databand environment and review your pipelines.
