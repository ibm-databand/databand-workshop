Section 2: databand.ai
a. Access databand.ai
First let's access the Databand environment. You will be provided with the required URL and account credentials. Browse through the different parts of the Databand environment. Do not break the environment!

b. Create token
When you want your Python pipelines to be monitored by Databand, they need to be adjusted to push their logging metadata to the relevant Databand environment related to your account. For that you need a Databand access token. You will be shown where this done. 

Adjust all (3) Python scripts:
"databand_url": "<databand_url>" -> replace <databand_url> with the provided URL 
"databand_access_token": "<databand_access_token>" -> replace <databand_access_token> with your created or privided token

Be aware: Depending on the workshop group size you will not get equal amount account credentials. In that case you will share account credentials and access tokens.
