# databand-workshop

Codebase for the Databand.ai enablement workshop.

With this codebase we provide exercizes on how to integrate Databand into your pipelines, using different implementation technologies for those pipelines. At this moment these are:
- Python
- Airflow

During time we will extend this list.

This enablement workshop is not focussing on expert level technology usage, therefore the pipelines examples are very basic. The focus is on how to integrate Databand into them.

We have been using PyCharm as or base editor (for now) but you can use any you prefer, there are some requirements though:
- Know you editor of liking and have it installed
- For both Python and Airflow go up to (and not beyond) version 3.9
